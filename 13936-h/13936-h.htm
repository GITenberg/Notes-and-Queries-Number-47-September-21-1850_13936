<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>OLD SONGS.</h3>
<p>I heard, "in other days," a father singing a comic old song to
one of his children, who was sitting on his knee. This was in
Yorkshire: and yet it could hardly be a Yorkshire song, as the
scene was laid in another county. It commenced with&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Randle O'Shay has sold his mare</p>
<p>For nineteen groats at Warrin'ton fair,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and goes on to show how the simpleton was cheated out of his
money.</p>
<p>I find in Hasted's <i>History of Kent</i> (vol. i. p. 468., 2nd
edit.) mention made of the family of Shaw, who held the manor of
Eltham, &amp;c., and who "derive themselves from the county
palatine of Chester." It is further stated that <i>Randal de
Shaw</i>, his son, was settled at Haslington Hall in that
county.</p>
<p>All, indeed, that this proves is, the probability of the hero of
the song being also a native of Cheshire, or one of the adjacent
counties; and that the legend is a truth, even as to names as well
as general facts. The song is worthy of recovery and preservation,
as a remnant of English character and manners; and I have only
referred to Hasted to point out the probable district in which it
will be found.</p>
<p>There are many other characteristics of the manners of the
humbler classes to be found in songs that had great local
popularity within the period of living memory; for instance, the
<i>Wednesbury Cocking</i> amongst the colliers of Staffordshire and
<i>Rotherham Status</i> amongst the cutlers of Sheffield. Their
language, it is true, is not always very delicate&mdash;perhaps was
not even at the time these songs were composed,&mdash;as they
picture rather the exuberant freaks of a half-civilised people than
the better phases of their character. Yet even these form "part and
parcel" of the history of "the true-born Englishman."</p>
<p>One song more may be noticed here:&mdash;the rigmarole, snatches
of which probably most of us have heard, which contains an immense
number of mere truisms having no connexion with each others, and no
bond of union but the metrical form in which their juxtaposition is
effected, and the rhyme, which is kept up very well throughout,
though sometimes by the introduction of a nonsense line. Who does
not remember&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A yard of pudding's not an ell,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Not forgetting <i>dytherum di</i>,</p>
<p>A tailor's goose can never fly,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and other like parts?</p>
<p>It is just such a piece of burlesque as Swift might have
written: but many circumstances lead me to think it must be much
older. Has it ever been printed?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id=
"page258"></a>{258}</span>
<p>There is another old (indeed an evidently very ancient) song,
which I do not remember to have seen in print, or even referred to
in print. None of the books into which I have looked, from deeming
them likely to contain it, make the least reference to this song. I
have heard it in one of the midland counties, and in one of the
western, both many years ago; but I have not heard it in London or
any of the metropolitan districts. The song begins thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"London Bridge is broken down,</p>
<p class="i2">Dance over my Lady Lea:</p>
<p>London Bridge is broken down,</p>
<p class="i2">With a gay lad&eacute;e."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This must surely refer to some event preserved in
history,&mdash;may indeed be well known to well-read antiquaries,
though so totally unknown to men whose general pursuits (like my
own) have lain in other directions. The present, however, is an age
for "popularising" knowledge; and your work has assumed that task
as one of its functions.</p>
<p>The difficulties attending such inquiries as arise out of
matters so trivial as an old ballad, are curiously illustrated by
the answers already printed respecting the "wooing frog." In the
first place, it was attributed to times within living memory; then
shown to exceed that period, and supposed to be very
old,&mdash;even as old as the Commonwealth, or, perhaps, as the
Reformation. This is objected to, from "the style and wording of
the song being evidently of a much later period than the age of
Henry VIII.;" and Buckingham's "mad" scheme of taking Charles into
Spain to woo the infanta is substituted. This is enforced by the
"burden of the song;" whilst another correspondent considers this
"chorus" to be an old one, analogous to "Down derry
down:"&mdash;that is, M. denies the force of MR. MAHONY's
explanation altogether!</p>
<p>(Why MR. MAHONY calls a person in his "sixth decade" a
"sexagenarian" he best knows. Such is certainly not the ordinary
meaning of the term he uses. His pun is good, however.)</p>
<p>Then comes the HERMIT OF HOLYPORT, with a very decisive proof
that neither in the time of James I., nor of the Commonwealth,
could it have originated. His transcript from Mr. Collier's
<i>Extracts</i> carries it undeniably back to the middle of the
reign of Elizabeth. Of course, it is interesting to find
intermediate versions or variations of the ballad, and even the
adaptation of its framework to other ballads of recent times, such
as "Heigho! says Kemble,"&mdash;one of the Drury Lane "O.P. Row"
ballads (<i>Rejected Addresses</i>, last ed., or Cunningham's
<i>London</i>). Why the conjecture respecting Henry VIII. is so
contemptuously thrown aside as a "fancy," I do not see. A
<i>fancy</i> is a dogma taken up without proof, and in the teeth of
obvious probability,&mdash;tenaciously adhered to, and all
investigation eschewed. This at least is the ordinary signification
of the term, in relation to the search after truth. How far my own
conjecture, or the mode of putting it, fulfills these conditions,
it is not necessary for me to discuss: but I hope the usefulness
and interest of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" will not be marred by any
discourtesy of one correspondent towards another.</p>
<p>At the same time, the HERMIT OF HOLYPORT has done the most
essential service to this inquiry by his extract from Mr. Collier,
as the question is thereby inclosed within exceedingly narrow
limits. But if the ballad do not refer to Henry VIII., to whom can
it be referred with greater probability? It is too much to assume
that all the poetry, wit, and talent of the Tudor times were
confined to the partizans of the Tudor cause, religious or
political. We <i>know</i>, indeed, the contrary. But for his
communication, too, the singular coincidence of two such
characteristic words of the song in the "Poley Frog" (in the same
number of the "NOTES AND QUERIES") might have given rise to another
conjecture: but the <i>date</i> excludes its further
consideration.</p>
<p>I may add, that since this has been mooted, an Irish gentleman
has told me that the song was familiar enough in Dublin; and he
repeated some stanzas of it, which were considerably different from
the version of W.A.G., and the chorus the same as in the common
English version. I hope presently to receive a complete copy of it:
which, by the bye, like everything grotesquely humorous in Ireland,
was attributed to the author of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.</p>

<hr />
<h3>"JUNIUS IDENTIFIED."</h3>
<p>It is fortunate for my reputation that I am still living to
vindicate my title to the authorship of my own book, which seems
otherwise in danger of being taken from me.</p>
<p>I can assure your correspondent R.J. (Vol. ii., p. 103.) that I
was not only "literally <i>the writer</i>," (as he kindly suggests,
with a view of saving my credit for having put my name to the
book), but in its fullest sense <i>the author of "Junius
Identified"</i>; and that I never received the slightest assistance
from Mr. Dubois, or any other person, either in collecting or
arranging the evidence, or in the composition and correction of the
work. After I had completed my undertaking, I wrote to Mr. Dubois
to ask if he would allow me to see the handwriting of Sir Philip
Francis, that I might <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id=
"page259"></a>{259}</span> compare it with the published
fac-similes of the handwriting of Junius; but he refused my
request. His letter alone disproved the notion entertained by R.J.
and others, that Mr. Dubois was in any degree connected with me, or
with the authorship of the work in question.</p>
<p>With regard to the testimony of Lord Campbell, I wrote to his
lordship in February, 1848, requesting his acceptance of a copy of
<i>Junius Identified</i>, which I thought he might not have seen;
and having called his attention to my name at the end of the
preface, I begged he would, when opportunity offered, correct his
error in having attributed the work to Mr. Dubois. I was satisfied
with his lordship's reply, which was to the effect that he was
ashamed of his mistake, and would take care to correct it. No new
edition of that series of the <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i>,
which contains the "Life of Lord Loughborough," has since been
published. The present edition is dated 1847.</p>
<p>R.J. says further, that "the late Mr. George Woodfall always
spoke of the <i>pamphlet</i> as the work of Dubois;" and that Sir
Fortunatus Dwarris states, "the <i>pamphlet</i> is said, I know not
with what truth, to have been prepared under the eye of Sir Philip
Francis, it may be through the agency of Dubois." If <i>Junius
Identified</i> be alluded to in these observations as a
<i>pamphlet</i>, it would make me doubt whether R.J., or either of
his authorities, ever saw the book. It is an 8vo. vol. The first
edition, containing 380 pages, was published in 1816, at
12<i>s.</i> The second edition, which included the supplement,
exceeded 400 pages, and was published in 1818, at 14<i>s.</i> The
supplement, which contains the plates of handwriting, was sold
separately at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, to complete the first edition,
but this could not have been the pamphlet alluded to in the
preceding extracts. I suspect that when the work is spoken of as a
pamphlet, and this if often done, the parties thus describing it
have known it only through the medium of the critique in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Dubois was the author of the biography of Sir Philip
Francis, first printed in the <i>Monthly Mirror</i> for May and
June, 1810, and reprinted in <i>Junius Identified</i>, with
acknowledgment of the source from which it was taken. To this
biography the remarks of Sir Fortunatus Dwarris are strictly
applicable, except that it never appeared in the form of a
pamphlet.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Spiders a Cure for Ague</i> (Vol. ii., p. 130.).&mdash;Seeing
a note on this subject reminds me that a few years since, a lady in
the south of Ireland was celebrated far and near, amongst her
poorer neighbours, for the cure of this disorder. Her universal
remedy was a large house-spider alive, and enveloped in treacle or
preserve. Of course the parties were carefully kept in ignorance of
what the wonderful remedy was.</p>
<p>Whilst I am on the subject of cures, I may as well state that in
parts of the co. Carlow, the blood drawn from a black cat's ear,
and rubbed upon the part affected, is esteemed a certain cure for
St. Anthony's fire.</p>
<p class="author">JUNIOR.</p>
<p><i>Funeral Superstition.</i>&mdash;A few days ago the body of a
gentleman in this neighbourhood was conveyed to the hearse, and
while being placed in it, the door of the house, whether from
design or inadvertence I know not, was closed before the friends
came out to take their places in the coaches. An old lady, who was
watching the proceedings, immediately exclaimed, "God bless me!
they have closed the door upon the corpse: there will be another
death in that house before many days are over." She was fully
impressed with this belief, and unhappily this impression has been
confirmed. The funeral was on Saturday, and on the Monday morning
following a young man, resident in the house, was found dead in
bed, having died under the influence of chloroform, which he had
inhaled, self-administered, to relieve the pain of toothache or
tic-douloureux.</p>
<p>Perhaps the superstition may have come before you already; but
not having met with it myself, I thought it might be equally new to
others.</p>

<h3>EMENDATION OF A PASSAGE IN THE "TEMPEST."</h3>
<p>Premising that I should approach the text of our great poet with
an almost equal degree of awful reverence with that which
characterises his two latest editors, I must confess that I should
not have the same respect for evident errors of the printers of the
early editions, which they have occasionally shown. In the
following passage in the <i>Tempest</i>, Act i., Scene 1., this
forbearance has not, however, been the cause of the very
unsatisfactory state in which they have both left it. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id=
"page260"></a>{260}</span> must be indulged in citing at length,
that the context may the more clearly show what was really the
poet's meaning:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Enter FERDINAND <i>bearing a Log</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>Fer.</i> There be some sports are painful; and their
labour</p>
<p>Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness</p>
<p>Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters</p>
<p>Point to rich ends. This my mean task</p>
<p>Would be as heavy to me, as odious; but</p>
<p>The mistress, which I serve, quickens what's dead,</p>
<p>And makes my labours pleasures: O! she is</p>
<p>Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed;</p>
<p>And he's composed of harshness. I must remove</p>
<p>Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,</p>
<p>Upon a sore injunction: My sweet mistress</p>
<p>Weeps when she sees me work; and says such business</p>
<p>Had never like executor. I forget:</p>
<p>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours;</p>
<p>Most busy lest when I do it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Collier reads these last two lines thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours;</p>
<p>Most busy, least when I do it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>with the following note&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The meaning of this passage seems to have been misunderstood by
all the commentators. Ferdinand says that the thoughts of Miranda
so refresh his labours, that when he is most busy he seems to feel
his toil <i>least</i>. It is printed in the folio 1623,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Most busy <i>lest</i> when I do it,'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;a trifling error of the press corrected in the folio
1632, although Theobald tells us that both the oldest editions read
<i>lest</i>. Not catching the poet's meaning, he
printed,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Most busy-<i>less</i> when I do it,'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>and his supposed emendation has ever since been taken as the
text; even Capell adopted it. I am happy in having Mr. Amyot's
concurrence in this restoration."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Knight adopts Theobald's reading, and Mr. Dyce approves it
in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Theobald made the emendation, 'Most busy-<i>less</i>,' he
observed that 'the corruption was so very little removed from the
truth of the text, that he could not afford to think well of his
own sagacity for having discovered it.' The correction is, indeed,
so obvious that we may well wonder that it had escaped his
predecessors; but we must wonder ten times more that one of his
successors, in a blind reverence for the old copy, should
re-vitiate the text, and defend a corruption which outrages
language, taste, and common sense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although at an earlier period of life I too adopted Theobald's
supposed emendation, it never satisfied me. I have my doubts
whether the word <i>busyless</i> existed in the poet's time; and if
it did, whether he could possibly have used it here. Now it is
clear that <i>labours</i> is a misprint for <i>labour</i>; else, to
what does "when I do <i>it</i>" refer? <i>Busy lest</i> is only a
typographical error for <i>busyest</i>: the double superlative was
commonly used, being considered as more emphatic, by the poet and
his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Thus in Hamlet's letter, Act ii. Sc. 2.:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I love thee best, O <i>most best</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and in <i>King Lear</i>, Act ii. Sc. 3.:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"To take the basest and <i>most poorest</i> shape."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The passage will then stand thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But these sweet thoughts, do even refresh my labour,</p>
<p>Most busiest when I do it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sense will be perhaps more evident by a mere transposition,
preserving every word:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But these sweet thoughts, most busiest when I do</p>
<p>My labour, do even refresh it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we have a clear sense, devoid of all ambiguity, and
confirmed by what precedes; that his labours are made pleasures,
being beguiled by these sweet thoughts of his mistress, which are
busiest when he labours, because it excites in his mind the memory
of her "weeping to see him work." The correction has also the
recommendation of being effected in so simple a manner as by merely
taking away two superfluous letters. I trust I need say no more;
secure of the approbation of those who (to use the words of an
esteemed friend on another occasion) feel "that making an opaque
spot in a great work transparent is not a labour to be scorned, and
that there is a pleasant sympathy between the critic and
bard&mdash;dead though he be&mdash;on such occasions, which is an
ample reward."</p>

<h3>PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., pp. 6. 50. 90. 165.)</h4>
<p>In the "NOTES AND QUERIES" of Saturday, the 10th of August,
SENEX gives some account of the burning of a female in the Old
Bailey, "about the year 1788."</p>
<p>Having myself been present at the last execution of a female in
London, where the body was burnt (being probably that to which
SENEX refers), and as few persons who were then present may now be
alive, I beg to mention some circumstances relative to that
execution, which appear to be worthy of notice.</p>
<p>Our criminal law was then most severe and cruel: the legal
punishment of females convicted of high treason and petty treason
was burning; coining was held to be high treason; and murder of a
husband was petty treason.</p>
<p>I see it stated in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, that on the
13th of March, 1789,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Recorder of London made his report to His Majesty of the
prisoners under sentence of death in Newgate, convicted in the
Sessions of September, October, November, and January (forty-six in
number), <span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id=
"page261"></a>{261}</span> fourteen of whom were ordered for
execution; five of whom were afterwards reprieved."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recorder's report in regard to these unfortunate persons had
been delayed during the incapacity of the king; thus the report for
four sessions had been made at once. To have decided at one sitting
of council upon such a number of cases, must have almost been
enough to overset the strongest mind. Fortunately, these reports
are now abolished.</p>
<p>In the same number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, under
date the 18th of March, there is this statement,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The nine following malefactors were executed before the
Debtors' Door at Newgate pursuant to their sentence, viz., Hugh
Murphy and Christian Murphy <i>alias</i> Bowman, Jane Grace, and
Joseph Walker, for coining. [Four for burglary, and one for highway
robbery.] They were brought upon the scaffold, about half an hour
after seven, and <i>turned off</i> about a quarter past eight. The
woman for coining was brought out after the rest were turned off,
and fixed to a stake and burnt; being first strangled by the stool
being taken from under her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the execution at which I was present; the number of
those who suffered, and the burning of the female, attracted a very
great crowd. Eight of the malefactors suffered on the scaffold,
then known as "the new drop." After they were suspended, the woman,
in a white dress, was brought out of Newgate alone; and after some
time spent in devotion, was hung on the projecting arm of a low
gibbet, fixed at a little distance from the scaffold. After the
lapse of a sufficient time to extinguish life, faggots were piled
around her, and over her head, so that her person was completely
covered: fire was then set to the pile, and the woman was consumed
to ashes.</p>
<p>In the following year, 1790, I heard sentence passed in the
Criminal Court, in the Old Bailey, upon other persons convicted of
coining: one of them was a female. The sentence upon her was, that
she should be "drawn to the place of execution, and there burnt
with fire till she was dead."</p>
<p>The case of this unfortunate woman, and the cruel state of the
law in regard to females, then attracted attention. On the 10th of
May, 1790, Sir Benjamin Hammett, in his place in the House of
Commons, called the attention of that House to the then state of
the law. He mentioned that it had been his official duty to attend
on the melancholy occasion of the burning of the female in the
preceding year (it is understood he was then one of the sheriffs of
London), he moved for leave to bring in a bill to alter the law,
which he characterised as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the savage remains of Norman policy, disgracing our
statute book, as the practice did the common law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He noticed that the sheriff who did not execute the sentence of
burning alive was liable to a prosecution; but he thanked Heaven
there was not a man in England who would carry such a sentence into
effect. He obtained leave to bring in a bill for altering this
cruel law; and in that session the Act 30 G. III. c. 48. was
passed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For discontinuing the judgment which has been required by law
to be given against women convicted of certain crimes, and
substituting another judgment in lieu thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A debt of gratitude is due to the memory of Sir Benjamin
Hammett, for his exertions, at that period, in the cause of
humanity. Thank God, we now live in times when the law is less
cruel, and more chary of human life.</p>

<h3>A NOTE ON MORGANATIC MARRIAGES.</h3>
<p>Grimm (<i>Deutsche Rechts Alterthumer</i>, vol. ii., p. 417.),
after a long dissertation, in which it appears that the money paid
by the bridegroom to the wife's relations (I believe subsequently
also to the wife herself) had every form of a <i>purchase</i>,
possibly derived also from some <i>symbolic</i> customs common to
all northern tribes, offers the following as the origin of this
word "morganatic:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Es gab aber im Alterthum noch einen erlaubten Ausweg f&uuml;r
die Verbindung vorneluner M&auml;nner mit geringen (freien und
selbst unfreien) Frauen, den <i>Concubinat</i>, der ohne
feierliches Verl&ouml;bniss, ohne <i>Brautgabe</i> und
<i>Mitgift</i> eingegangen wurde, mithin <i>keine wahre und volle
Ehe</i>, dennoch ein rechtm&auml;ssiges Verh&auml;ltniss war.</p>
<p>"Da jedoch die Kirche ein solches Verh&auml;ltniss missbilligte
durch keine Einsegnung weihte, so wurde es allm&auml;hlich
unerlaubt und verboten als Ausnahme aber bis auf die neueste Zeit
f&uuml;r F&uuml;rsten zugelassen&mdash;ja durch Trauung an die
linke Hand gefeiert. Die Benennung Morganatische
Ehe,&mdash;Matrimonium ad Morganaticam (11. Feud. 29.), r&uuml;hrt
daher, dass <i>den Concubinen</i> eine <i>Morgangabe</i> (woraus im
Mittelalter die Lombarden '<i>Morganatica</i>'
machten)&mdash;bewilligt zu werden pflegte&mdash;<i>es waren Ehen
auf blosse Morgengabe</i>. Den Beweis liefern Urkunden, die
Morganatica f&uuml;r Morgengabe auch in Fallen gebrauchen wo von
wahrer Ehe die Rede ist." (See Heinecius, <i>Antiq</i>. 3. 157,
158.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case now stands thus:</p>
<p>It was the custom to give money to the wife's relations on the
marriage-day.</p>
<p>It was not the custom with respect to unequal marriage
(Misheirath): this took place "ohne Brautgabe und Mitgift," which
was also of later origin.</p>
<p>The exception made by the Church for <i>princes</i>, restored
the woman so far, that the marriage was legally and morally
recognised by the Lombard law and the Church, with exceptions as
regards <i>issue</i>, and that the left hand was given for the
<i>right</i>.</p>
<p>With regard to this latter, it would be desirable <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>{262}</span> to trace
whether giving of the land had any <i>symbolic</i> meaning. I think
the astrologists consider the right as the nobler part of the body;
if so, giving of <i>the left</i> in this case is not without
symbolic significance. It must be remembered how much symbolism
prevailed among the tribes which swept Europe on the fall of the
Roman empire, and their Eastern origin.</p>
<p>The Morgengabe, according to Cancianus (<i>Leges Barbarorum</i>,
tom. iv. p. 24.), was at first a <i>free gift</i> made by the
husband after the first marriage night. This was carried to such
excess, that Liutprand ordained</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tamen ipsum Morgengabe volumus, ut non sit amplius nisi quarta
pars ejus substantia, qui ipsum Morgengabe dedit."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This became subsequently converted into a <i>right</i> termed
<i>justitia</i>.</p>
<p>Upon this extract from a charter,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Manifesta causa est mihi, quoniam die ilio quando te sposavi,
promiseram tibi dare <i>justitiam</i> tuam secundum <i>legem
meam</i> [qr. <i>my Lombard</i> law in opposition to the Roman,
which he had a right to choose,] in Morgencap, id est, quartam
portionem omnium rerum mobilium et immobilium," &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cancianus thus comments:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Animadverte, quam recte charta h&aelig;c cum supra alligatis
formulis conveniat. Sponsus promiserat Morgencap, quando feminam
desponsaverat, inde vero ante conjugium chartam conscribit: et quod
et Liutprandi lege, et ex antiquis moribus <i>Donum</i> fuit mere
gratuitum, hic appellatur <i>Justitia</i> secundum legem
Langobardorum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Morgencap here assumes, I apprehend, somewhat the form of
<i>dower</i>. That it was so, is very doubtful. (Grimm, vol. ii. p.
441. "Morgengabe.")</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An demselben Morgen empf&auml;ngt die JungFrau von ihrem Gemahl
ein ansehnliches Geschenk, welches Morgengabe heisst. Schon in der
Pactio Guntherammi et Childeberti, werden Dos und Morganagiba
<i>unterschieden</i>, ebenso <i>Leg. Rip.</i> 37. 2. <i>Alaman</i>.
56. 1, 2. Dos und Morgangeba; <i>Lex Burgend.</i> 42. 2. Morgangeba
und das 'pretium nuptiale;' bei den Langobarden, 'Meta und
Morgengab.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not say this answers the question of your correspondent G.,
which is, what is the <i>derivation</i> of the word?</p>
<p>Its actual signification, I think, means left-handed; but to
think is not to resolve, and the question is open to the charitable
contributions of your learned and able supporters.</p>
<p>As regards the Fairy Morgana, who was married to a mortal, I
confess, with your kind permission, I had rather not accept her as
a satisfactory reply. It is as though you would accept "once upon a
time" as a chronological date! She was <i>married</i> to a
mortal&mdash;true; but <i>morganatically</i>, I doubt it. If
morganatic came from this, it should appear the <i>Fairy
Morgana</i> was the <i>first lady</i> who so underwent the
ceremony. Do not forget Lurline, who married also a mortal, of whom
the poet so prettily sings:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Lurline hung her head,</p>
<p class="i10">Turned pale, and then red;</p>
<p>And declared his abruptness in popping the question</p>
<p>So soon after dinner had spoilt her digestion."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This lady's marriage resembled the other in all respects, and I
leave you to decide, and no man is more competent, from your
extensive knowledge of the mythology of Medieval Europe, whether
Morgana, beyond the mere accident of her name, was more likely than
Lurline to have added a word with a puzzling etymology to the
languages of Europe. The word will, I think, be found of Eastern
origin, clothed in a Teutonic form.</p>
<p>After all, Jacob Grimm and Cancianus may interest your readers,
and so I send the Note.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Alderman Beckford.</i>&mdash;Gifford (<i>Ben Jonson</i>, vol.
vi. p. 481.) has the following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The giants of Guildhall, thank heaven, yet defend their charge:
it only remains to wish that the citizens may take example by the
fate of Holmeby, and not expose them to an attack to which they
will assuredly be found unequal. It is not altogether owing to
their wisdom that this has not already taken place. For twenty
years they were chained to the car of a profligate buffoon, who
dragged them through every species of ignominy to the verge of
rebellion; and their hall is even yet disgraced with the statue of
a worthless negro-monger, in the act of insulting their sovereign
with a speech of which (factious and brutal as he was) <i>he never
uttered one syllable</i>." ... "By my troth, captain, these are
very bitter words."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Gifford was <i>generally</i> correct in his assertions; and
twenty-two years after <i>his</i> note, I made the following
one:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is a curious fact, but a true one, that Beckford <i>did not
utter one syllable of this speech</i>. It was penned by Horne
Tooke, and by his art put on the records of the city and on
Beckford's statue, as he told me, Mr. Braithwaite, Mr. Seyers,
&amp;c., at the Athenian Club.</p>
<p>"ISAAC REED.</p>
<p>"See the <i>Times</i> Of July 23. 1838, p. 6."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The worshipful Company of Ironmongers have <i>relegated
their</i> statue from their hall to a lower position: but it still
disgraces the Guildhall, and will continue to do so, as long as any
factious demagogue is permitted to have a place among its
members.</p>

section treating of Muscovy, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This excesse of cold in the ayre, gave occasion to
<i>Castilian</i>, in his <i>Aulicus</i>, wittily and not
incongruously to faine that if two men being smewhat distant, talke
together in the winter, their words will be so frozen that they
cannot be heard: but if the parties in the spring returne to the
same place, their words will melt in the same order that they were
frozen and <i>spoken</i>, and be plainly understood."</p>

<p>The idiom is still in use in Scotland. "You had better not begin
to me," is the first address or colloquy of the school-boy
half-angry half-frightened at the bullying of a companion. The
idiom was once English, though now obsolete. Several instances of
it are given in the last edition of Foxe's <i>Martyrs</i>, vol. vi.
p. 627. It has not been noticed, however, that the same idiom
occurs in one of the best known passages of Shakspeare; in

<blockquote>
<p>"Fourthly, that the woman was made of a rib out of the side of

<p><i>Beau Brummel's Ancestry.</i>&mdash;Mr. Jesse some years back
did ample justice to the history of a "London celebrity," George
Brummell; but, from what he there stated, the following "Note"
will, I feel assured, be a novelty to him. At the time that
Brummell was considered in everything the <i>arbiter
elegantiarum</i>, the writer of this has frequently heard Lady
Monson (the widow of the second lord, and an old lady who, living
to the age of ninety-seven, had a wonderful fund of interesting
recollections) say, that this ruler of fashion was the descendant
of a very excellent servant in the family. Not long ago, some old
papers of the family being turned over, proofs corroborative of
this came to light. William Brummell, from the year 1734 to 1764,
was the faithful and confidential servant of Charles Monson,
brother of the first lord: the period would identify him with the
grandfather of the Beau; the only doubt was, that as Mr. Jesse has
ascertained that William Brummell, the grandfather, was, in the
interval above given, married, had a <i>son William</i>, and owned
a house in Bury Street, how far these facts were compatible with
his remaining as a servant living with Charles Monson, both in town
and country. Now, in 1757, Professor Henry Monson of Cambridge
being dangerously ill, his brother Charles sent William Brummell
down, as a trustworthy person, to attend to him; and in a letter
from Brummell to his master, he, with many other requisitions,
wishes that there may be sent down to him a certain glass vessel,
very useful for invalids to drink out of, and which, if not in
Spring Gardens, "may be found in <i>Bury Street</i>. It was used
when <i>Billy</i> was ill." From the familiarity of the word
"Billy," he must be speaking of his son. These facts are certainly
corroborative of the old dowager's statement.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>GRAY'S ELEGY AND DODSLEY POEMS.</h3>
<p>I have here, in the country, few editions of Gray's works by me,
and those not the best; for instance, I have neither of those by
the Rev. J. Mitford (excepting his Aldine edition, in one small
volume), which, perhaps, would render my present Query needless. It
relates to a line, or rather a word in the <i>Elegy</i>, which is
of some importance. In the second stanza, as the poem is usually
divided (though Mason does not give it in stanzas, because it was
not so originally written), occurs,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And thus the line stands in all the copies (five) I am able at
this moment to consult. But referring to Dodsley's <i>Collection of
Poems</i>, vol. iv., where it comes first, the epithet applied to
"flight" is not "droning," but <i>drony</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Save where the beetle wheels his <i>drony</i> flight."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Has anybody observed upon this difference, which surely is
worthy of a Note? I cannot find that the circumstance has been
remarked upon, but, as I said, I am here without the means of
consulting the best authorities. The <i>Elegy</i>, I presume, must
have been first separately printed, and from thence transferred to
Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>; and I wish to be informed by some
person who has the earliest impression, how the line is there
given? I do not know any one to whom I can appeal on such a point
with greater confidence than to MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM, who, I know,
has a large assemblage of the first editions of our most celebrated
poets from the reign of Anne downwards, and is so well able to make
use of them. It would be extraordinary, if <i>drony</i> were the
epithet first adopted by Gray, and subsequently altered by him to
"droning," that no notice should have been taken of the
substitution by any of the poet's editors. I presume, therefore,
that it has been mentioned, and I wish to know where?</p>
<p>Now, a word or two on Dodsley's <i>Collection of Poems</i>, in
the fourth volume of which, as I have <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>{265}</span> stated,
Gray's-<i>Elegy</i> comes first. Dodsley's is a popular and
well-known work, and yet I cannot find <i>that anybody has given
the dates connected with it accurately</i>. If Gray's <i>Elegy</i>
appeared in it for the first time (which I do not suppose), it came
out in 1755 which is the date of vol. iv. of Dodsley's
<i>Collection</i>, and not in 1757, which is the date of the
Strawberry Hill edition of Gray's <i>Odes</i>. The Rev. J. Mitford
(Aldine edit. xxxiii.) informs us that "Dodsley published three
volumes of this <i>Collection</i> in 1752; the fourth volume was
published in 1755 and the fifth and sixth volumes, which completed
the <i>Collection</i>, in 1758." I am writing with the title-pages
of the work open before me, and I find that the first three volumes
were published, not in 1752, but in 1748, and that even this was
the second edition so that there must have been an edition of the
first three volumes, either anterior to 1748, or earlier in that
year. The sale of the work encouraged Dodsley to add a fourth
volume in 1755, and two others in 1758 and the plate of Apollo and
the Muses was re-engraved for vols. v. and vi., because the
original copper, which had served for vols. i., ii., iii., and iv.,
was so much worn.</p>
<p>This matter will not seem of such trifling importance to those
who bear in mind, that if Gray's <i>Elegy</i> did not originally
come out in this <i>Collection</i> in 1755, various other poems of
great merit and considerable popularity did then make their
earliest appearance.</p>
<p class="author">THE HERMIT OF HOLYPORT.</p>
<p>Sept. 1850.</p>
<p>P.S. My attention has been directed to the subject of Gray's
<i>Poems</i>, and particularly to his <i>Elegy</i>, by a recent
pilgrimage I made to Stoke Poges, which is only five or six miles
from this neighbourhood. The church and the poet's monument to his
mother are worth a much longer walk; but the mausoleum to Gray, in
the immediate vicinity, is a preposterous edifice. The residence of
Lady Cobham has been lamentably modernised.</p>

<h3>HUGH HOLLAND AND HIS WORKS.</h3>
<p>The name of Hugh Holland has been handed down to posterity in
connexion with that of our immortal bard; but few know anything of
him beyond his commendatory verses prefixed to the first folio of
Shakspeare.</p>
<p>He was born at Denbigh in 1558, and educated at Westminster
School while Camden taught there. In 1582 he matriculated at Baliol
College, Oxford; and about 1590 he succeeded to a Fellowship at
Trinity College, Cambridge. Thence he travelled into Italy, and at
Rome was guilty of several indiscretions by the freedom of his
conversations. He next went to Jerusalem to pay his devotions at
the Holy Sepulchre, and on his return touched at Constantinople,
where he received a reprimand from the English ambassador for the
former freedom of his tongue. At his return to England, he retired
to Oxford, and, according to Wood, spent some years there for the
sake of the public library. He died in July, 1633, and was buried
in Westminster Abbey, "in the south crosse aisle, neere the dore of
St. Benet's Chapell," but no inscription now remains to record the
event.</p>
<p>Whalley, in Gifford's <i>Jonson</i> (1. cccxiv.), says, speaking
of Hugh Holland&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He wrote several things, amongst which is the life of Camden;
but none of them, I believe, have been ever published."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holland published two works, the titles of which are as follows,
and perhaps others which I am not aware of:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. "Monumenta Sepulchralia Sancti Pauli. Lond. 1613. 4to."</p>
<p>2. "A Cypres Garland for the Sacred Forehead of our late
Soveraigne King James. Lond. 1625. 4to."</p>
<p>The first is a catalogue of the monuments, inscriptions, and
epitaphs in the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, which Nicolson calls
"a mean and dull performance." It was, at any rate, very popular,
being printed again in the years 1616, 1618, and 1633.</p>
<p>The second is a poetical tract of twelve leaves, of the greatest
possible rarity.</p>
<p>Holland also printed commendatory verses before a curious
musical work, entitled <i>Parthenia, or the Maydenhead of the First
Musick for the Virginalls</i>, 1611; and a copy of Latin verses
before Dr. Alexander's <i>Roxana</i>, 1632.</p>
<p>In one of the Lansdowne MSS. are preserved the following verses
written upon the death of Prince Henry, by "Hugh Hollande, fellow
of Trinity College, Cambridge:"&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Loe, where he shineth yonder</p>
<p>A fixed Star in heaven,</p>
<p>Whose motion here came under</p>
<p>None of the planets seven.</p>
<p>If that the Moone should tender</p>
<p>The Sun her love, and marry,</p>
<p>They both could not engender</p>
<p>So sweet a star as HARRY."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our author was evidently a man of some poetical fancy, and if
not worthy to be classed "among the chief of English poets," he is
at least entitled to a niche in the temple of fame.</p>
<p>My object in calling attention to this long forgotten author is,
to gain some information respecting his manuscript works. According
to Wood, they consist of&mdash;1. Verses in Description of the
chief Cities of Europe; 2. Chronicle of Queen Elizabeth's reign; 3.
Life of William Camden.</p>
<p>Can any of your readers say in whose possession, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>{266}</span> or in
what library, any of the above mentioned MSS. are at the present
time? I should also feel obliged for any communication respecting
Hugh Holland or his works, more especially frown original sources,
or books not easily accessible.</p>

<h3>HARVEY'S CLAIM TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE
BLOOD.</h3>
<p>I have both a Note and a Query about Harvey and the circulation
of the blood (Vol. ii., p. 187.). The Note refers to Philostratus
(<i>Life of Apollorius</i>, p. 461., ed. 1809), <i>Nouvelles de la
R&eacute;publique des Lettres</i>, June, 1684, xi.; and Dutens pp.
157-341. 4to. ed. 1796. I extract the passage from <i>Les
Nouvelles</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On voit avec plaisir un passage d'Andr&eacute; C&aelig;salpinus

p&egrave;re Paul d&eacute;couvrit la circulation du sang, et les
valvules des veines, mais qu'il n'osa pas en parler, de peur
d'exciter contre luy quelque temp&ecirc;te. Il n'etois

Il attendit &agrave; l'heure de sa mort pour mettre le livre qu'il

where doubtless, both those places of entertainment were. The Crown
and Anchor was the house where the Royal Society Club held its
convivial meetings. Can you inform me where the Cat and Bagpipes
was situated, and what literary and scientific club met there? The
name seems to have been a favourite one for taverns, and, if

<p>In the lines immediately referred to, where certain

ruined the host, and to have been not very profitable even to all
his descendants. A magnificent loin of meat being placed on the
table before his Majesty, the King was so struck with its size and
excellence, that he drew his sword, and cried out, "By my troth,
I'll knight thee, Sir Loin!" and then and there the title was

invited himself to dine with me, and brought Anthony Pearson and
several others along with him to dinner. That their principal
discourse all dinner time was only who it was that beheaded the
king. One said it was the common hangman; another, Hugh Peters;
others were also nominated, but none concluded. Robert Spavin, so
soon as dinner was done, took me by the hand, and carried me to the
south window. Saith he, 'These are all mistaken; they have not
named the man that did the fact: it was Lieutenant-Colonel Joice. I
was in the room when he fitted himself for the work; stood behind
him when he did it; when done, went in with him again: there is no
man knows this but my master, viz. Cromwell, Commissary Ireton, and
myself.'&mdash;'Doth Mr. Rushworth know it?' saith I. 'No, he doth
not know it,' saith Spavin. The same thing Spavin since has often

<p>The royal Halberdiers carried black bills. (Grose, <i>Milit.

were called black-guards from their dull appearance.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrims' Road</i> (Vol. ii., p. 237.).&mdash;Your

fact of importance, inasmuch as that the Archbishops of Canterbury
had there a handsome palace (the ruins of which still exist), which
is said to have been the favourite residence of Thomas &agrave;
Becket. The tradition in the county thereupon is, that his memory
was held in such sanctity in that neighbourhood as to cause a vast
influx of pilgrims annually from thence to his shrine at
Canterbury; and the line of road taken by them can still be traced,
though only portions of it are now used as a highway. The
direction, however, in which it runs makes it clear (as S.H., no
doubt, is aware) that it cannot be Chaucer's road.</p>
<p>While on the subject of old roads, I may add that a tradition
here exists that the direct road between London and Tunbridge did
not pass through Sevenoaks; and a narrow lane which crosses the
Pilgrims' road near Everham is pointed out as the former highway,
and by which Evelyn must have been journeying (passing close,
indeed, to the seat of his present descendant at St. Clere) when he
met with that amusing robber-adventure at Procession Oak.</p>

<p><i>Pilgrims' Road to Canterbury.</i>&mdash;In the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of Nov. 2nd, 1844, there is a notice of
<i>Remarks upon Wayside Chapels; with Observations on the
Architecture and present State of the Chantry on Wakefield
Bridge</i>: By John Chessell and Charles Buckler&mdash;in which the
reviewer says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our pedestrianism we have traced the now desolate ruins of
several of these chapels along the old pilgrims' road to
Canterbury."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this writer would give us the results of his pedestrianism,
it would be acceptable to <i>all</i> the lovers of Chaucer. I do
not know whether PHILO-CHAUCER will find anything to his purpose in
the pamphlet reviewed.</p>

<p><i>Combs buried with the Dead.</i>&mdash;In Vol. ii., p. 230.,
the excellent vicar of Morwenstow asks the reason why combs are
found in the graves of St. Cuthbert and others, monks, in the
cathedral church of Durham. I imagine that they were the combs used
at the first tonsure of the novices, to them a most interesting
memorial of that solemn rite through life, and from touching
affection to the brotherhood among whom they had dwelt, buried with
them at their death.</p>
<p class="author">M.W.</p>
<p><i>The Comb</i>, concerning "the origin and intent" of which MR.
HAWKER (Vol. ii., p. 230.) seeks information, was for ritual use;
and its purposes are fully described in Dr. Rock's <i>Church of our
Fathers</i>, t. ii. p. 122., &amp;c.</p>
<p class="author">LITURGICUS.</p>
<p><i>A&euml;rostation.</i>&mdash;C.B.M. will find in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for August 10th, 1850, a notice of a book on
this subject.</p>
<p class="author">E.S. JACKSON.</p>
<p><i>St. Thomas of Lancaster</i> (Vol. i., p. 181.).&mdash;MR.
R.M. MILNES desires information relative to "St. Thomas of
Lancaster." This personage was Earl of Leicester as well as Earl of
Lancaster; and I find in the archives of this borough numerous
entries relative to him,&mdash;of payments made to him by the
burgesses. Of these mention is made in a <i>History of
Leicester</i> recently published. The most curious fact I know of
is, that on the dissolution of the monasteries here, several relics
of St. Thomas, among others, his felt hat, was exhibited. The hat
was considered a great remedy for the headache!</p>
<p class="author">JAYTEE.</p>
<p><i>Smoke Money</i> (Vol. ii., p. 120.).&mdash;"Anciently, even
in England, were Whitsun farthings, or smoke farthings, which were
a composition for offerings made in Whitsun week, by every man who
occupied a house with a chimney, to the cathedral of the diocese in
which he lived."&mdash;Audley's <i>Companion to the Almanac</i>, p.
76.</p>
<p>Pentecostals, or Whitsun Farthings, are mentioned by Pegge as
being paid in 1788 by the parishioners of the diocese of Lichfield,
in aid of the repairs of the cathedral, to the dean and chapter;
but he makes no allusion to the word <i>smoke</i>, adding only that
in this case the payment went by the name of Chad-pennies, or
Chad-farthings, the cathedral there being dedicated to St.
Chad.</p>
<p class="author">C.I.R.</p>
<p><i>Robert Herrick</i> (Vol. i., p. 291.).&mdash;MR. MILNER BARRY
states that he found an entry of the burial of the poet Herrick in
the parish books of Dean Prior. As MR. BARRY seems interested in
the poet, I would inform him that a voluminous collection of family
letters of early date is now in the possession of William Herrick,
Esq., of Beaumanor Park, the present representative of that ancient
and honourable house.</p>
<p class="author">JAYTEE.</p>
<p><i>Guildhalls.</i>&mdash;The question in Vol. i., p. 320.,
relative to guildhalls, provokes an inquiry into <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> guilds.
In the erudite and instructive work of Wilda on the <i>Guild System
of the Middle Ages (Gildenwesen im Mittel&auml;lter)</i> will be
found to be stated that guilds were associations of various
kinds,&mdash;convivial, religions, and mercantile, and so on; and
that places of assembly were adopted by them. A guild-house where
eating and drinking took place, was to be met with in most villages
in early times: and these, I fancy, were the guild-halls. On this
head consult Hone's <i>Every-day Book</i>, vol. ii. p. 670., and
elsewhere, in connexion with Whitsuntide holidays.</p>
<p class="author">JAYTEE.</p>
<p><i>Abb&eacute; Strickland</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 198.
237.).&mdash;The fullest account of the Abb&eacute; Strickland,
<i>Bishop of Namur</i>, is to be found in Lord Hervey's
<i>Memoirs</i> (Vol. i., p. 391.), and a most curious account it is
of that profligate intriguer.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Long Lonkin</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 168. 251.).&mdash;This ballad
does not relate to Cumberland, but to Northumberland. This error
was committed by Miss Landon (in the <i>Drawing-room Scrap-book</i>
for 1835), to whom a lady of this town communicated the fragment
through the medium of a friend. Its real locality is a ruined
tower, seated on the corner of an extensive earth-work surrounded
by a moat, on the western side of Whittle Dean, near Ovingham.
Since this period, I have myself taken down many additional verses
from the recitation of the adjacent villagers, and will be happy to
afford any further information to your inquirer, SELEUCUS.</p>
<p class="author">G. BOUCHIER RICHARDSON.</p>
<p>Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sept. 7. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Havock</i> (Vol. ii., p. 215.).&mdash;The presumed object of
literary men being the investigation of truth, your correspondent
JARLTZBERG will, I trust, pardon me for suggesting that his
illustration of the word <i>havock</i> is incomplete, and
especially with reference to the line of Shakspeare which he has
quoted:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Cry havock! and let slip the dogs of war."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Grose, in his <i>History of English Armour</i>, vol. ii. p. 62.,
says that <i>havok</i> was the word given as a signal for the
troops to disperse and pillage, as may be learned from the
following article in the <i>Droits of the Marshal</i>, vol. ii. p.
229., wherein it is declared, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the article of plunder, all the sheep and hogs belong to
such private soldiers as can take them; and that on the word havok
being cried, every one might seize his part; but this probably was
only a small part of the licence supposed to be given by the
word."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also refers to the ordinance of Richard II.</p>
<p>In agreeing with your correspondent that the use of this word
was the signal for general massacre, unlimited slaughter, and
giving no quarter, as well as taking plunder in the manner
described above, the omission of which I have to complain is, that,
in stating no one was to raise the cry, under penalty of losing his
head, he did not add the words, "the king excepted." It was a royal
act; and Shakspeare so understood it to be; as will appear from the
passage referred to, if fully and fairly quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And C&aelig;sar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</p>
<p>With At&eacute; by his side, come hot from hell,</p>
<p>Shall in these confines, <i>with a monarch's voice</i>,</p>
<p>Cry Havock! and let slip the dogs of war."</p>
<p class="i10"><i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> Act iii.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is not at this moment in my power to assist F.W. with the
reference to the history of Bishop Berkeley's giant, though it
exists somewhere in print. The subject of the experiment was a
healthy boy, who died in the end, in consequence of over-growth,
promoted (as far as my recollection serves me) principally by a
peculiar diet.</p>
<p class="author">W(1).</p>
<p><i>Becket's Mother.</i>&mdash;I do not pretend to explain the
facts mentioned by MR. FOSS (Vol. ii., p. 106.), that the hospital
founded in honour of Becket was called "The Hospital of St. Thomas
the Martyr, <i>of Acon</i>;" and that he was himself styled "St.
Thomas <i>Acrenis</i>, or <i>of Acre</i>;" but I believe that the
true explanation must be one which would not be a hindrance to the
rejection of the common story as to the Archbishop's birth.
<i>If</i> these titles were intended to connect the Saint with Acre
in Syria, they may have originated after the legend had become
popular. But it seems to me more likely, that, like some other city
churches and chapels, that of St. Thomas got its designation from
something quite unconnected with the history of the patron. In
particular, I would ask what is the meaning of "St. Nicolas
<i>Acons</i>?" And may not the same explanation (whatever it be)
serve for "St. Thomas <i>of Acon</i>?" Or the hospital may have
been built on some noted "acre" (like <i>Long Acre</i> and
<i>Pedlars Acre</i>); and if afterwards churches in other places
were consecrated to St. Thomas under the designation "<i>of
Acre</i>," (as to which point I have no information), the churches
of "our Lady <i>of Loretto</i>," scattered over various countries,
will supply a parallel. As to the inference which Mr. Nichols
(<i>Pilgrimages</i>, p. 120.) draws from the name <i>Acrensis</i>,
that Becket was <i>born at</i> Acre, I must observe that it
introduces a theory which is altogether new, and not only opposed
to the opinion that the Archbishop was of English or Norman descent
on both sides, but <i>essentially</i> contradictory of the legend
as to the fair Saracen who came from the East in search of her
lover.</p>
<p class="author">J.C.R.</p>
<p><i>Watching the Sepulchre</i> (Vol. i., pp. 318. 354.
403.).&mdash;In the parish books of Leicester various entries
respecting the Sepulchre occur. In the year 1546, when a sale took
place of the furniture of St. Martin's Church, the "Sepulchre
light" was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id=
"page271"></a>{271}</span> sold to Richard Rainford for 21<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i> In the reign of Queen Mary gatherings were made for the
"Sepulchre lights;" timber for making the lights cost 5<i>s.</i>;
the light itself, 4<i>s.</i>; and painting the Sepulchre, and a
cloth for "our lady's altar," cost 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> Facts
like these might be multiplied.</p>
<p class="author">JAYTEE.</p>
<p><i>Portraits of Charles I. in Churches</i> (Vol. i., pp. 137.
184.).&mdash;In reference to this I have to state, that in the
south aisle of the church of St. Martin, in Leicester, a painting
of this kind is yet to be seen, or was lately. It was executed by a
Mr. Rowley, for 10<i>l.</i>, in the year 1686. It represents the
monarch in a kneeling attitude.</p>
<p class="author">JAYTEE.</p>
<p><i>Joachim, the French Ambassador</i> (Vol. ii., p.
229.).&mdash;In Rapin's <i>History of England</i> I find this
ambassador described as "Jean-Joachim de Passau, Lord of Vaux."

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>The Rev. Mackenzie Walcott, M.A., of Exeter College, Oxford,
whose pleasant gossiping <i>Memorials of Westminster</i>, and
<i>History of St. Margaret's Church</i>, are no doubt familiar to
many of our readers, is, as an old Wykehamist, collecting
information for a "History of Commoners and the Two S. Marie Winton
Colleges;" and will feel obliged by lists of illustrious alumni,
and any notes, arch&aelig;ological and historical, about that noble
school, which will be duly acknowledged.</p>
<p>The <i>Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological Association</i>, which was
established in 1846 for the purpose of promoting the study and
preservation of the antiquities of Wales and the Marches, held its
fourth anniversary meeting in the ancient and picturesque town of
Dolgelly, during the week commencing the 26th ultimo. The
Association is endeavouring to extend its usefulness by enlarging
the number of its members; and as its subscribing members receive
in return for their yearly pound, not only the Society's Journal,
the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> but also the annual volume
of valuable arch&aelig;ological matter published by the
Association, we cannot doubt but their exertions will meet the
sympathy and patronage of all who take an interest in the national
and historical remains of the principality.</p>
<p>The preceding paragraph was scarcely finished when we received
proof of the utility of the Association in Mr. Freeman's volume,
entitled <i>Remarks on the Architecture of Llandaff Cathedral, with
an Essay towards a History of the Fabric</i>&mdash;a volume which,
as we learn from the preface, had its origin in the observations on
some of the more singular peculiarities of the fabric made by the
author at the Cardiff meeting of the Association in 1849. These
remarks were further developed in a paper in the
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i>; and have now been expanded
into the present descriptive and historical account of a building
which, to use Mr. Freeman's words, "in many respects, both of its
history and architecture, stands quite alone among English
churches." Mr. Freeman's ability to do justice to such a subject is
well known: and his work will therefore assuredly find a welcome
from the numerous body of students of church architecture now to be
found in this country; and to their judgments we leave it.</p>
<p><i>Notes on Bishop Jeremy Taylor's Works.</i> A reprint being
called for of vol. vi. of the present edition of Bishop Taylor's
works, the Editor will be glad of any assistance towards verifying

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
